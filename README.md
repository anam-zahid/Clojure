# Clojure
Examples of Data science using clojure

core.clj file contains code for naive bayes implementation in clojure. To run this code, you need to add dependency of Smile in the project.clj file (attached). This code is generated using VS Code.

What is Smile?
Smile is a fast and comprehensive machine learning library for the JVM. It includes popular algorithms for classification (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests), regression (e.g., Ridge and LASSO, regression trees/forests), and clustering (K-Means,minimum entropy clustering, hierarchical clustering), as well as a host of tools for data preprocessing. It even has some basic NLP and data preparation tools basked in. 

[Latest version of Smile can be found at maven](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.haifengl/smile-core/1.5.1/jar)
